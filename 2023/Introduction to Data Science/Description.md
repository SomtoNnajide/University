In this assignment, I was given four data files in the CSV format. These files are collected from the internet for the COVID-19 pandemic for different regions and countries around the world for the period between 1/1/2020 and 5/5/2020. The data are described below. However, please note that the data is quite messy. The aim is to write R code (in the RMarkdown format) to import and wrangle these data files and put them in reasonable format to conduct analysis and do data-driven modelling on them.

The assignment is composed of four tasks, collated under the folder "Assignment Tasks" with accompanying questions in the .rmd files.

CSV descriptions:

- Covid19.csv: This is the master file that include information about the countries, continents and the daily new cases and daily new deaths in each country
- Tests.csv: This file lists information about the daily COVID-19 tests for each country
- Countries.csv: This file provides information about the countries
- Recovered.csv: This file presents information about the daily recovered cases in each country
