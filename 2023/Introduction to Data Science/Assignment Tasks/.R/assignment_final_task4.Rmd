# Task 4 - Insights (15 marks)

Imagine you have been asked to plan for a dashboard that shall show the trends and the main figures of the different Covid19 waves that happened world wide in the last pandemic. Given the current data in this assignment is only covering the first wave of the Covid19, how would you augment this data? What are the other sources of data that you will rely on? What types of figures will you be focusing on to show in your dashboard? and why?

**Task 4 Report**:

Write the report as follows:

1. **Objectives**:

To further analyse the different covid19 trends, different types of data would have to be 
accessed and implemented to create a comprehensive analysis.

Examples of the type of data needed include: 

a. Historical Data
b. Global Databases
c. Regional and National Data
d. Research Studies
e. Public Health Reports

A covid-19 trend to analyse is the impact of the pandemic on Australian Family Domestic 
and Sexual Violence. A segment of this data can be included in the dashboard.

2. **List of data sources to augment the existing data**:

Examples of reputable Australian data sources:

a. [Australian Government Department of Health](health.gov.au)
b. [Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)](abs.gov.au)
c. [State and Territory Health Departments](https://www.health.act.gov.au/)
d. [ABS Recorded Crime—Offenders, 2019–20 ](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/crime-and-justice/recorded-crime-offenders/latest-release)
e. [ABS Recorded Crime—Victims, 2020](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/crime-and-justice/recorded-crime-victims/latest-release)
f. [AIHW Child Protection National Minimum Data Set, 2019–20](https://www.aihw.gov.au/about-our-data/our-data-collections/child-protection-national-minimum-data-set)
g. [AIHW Specialist Homelessness Services Collection, monthly data, 2021–22](https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/homelessness-services/specialist-homelessness-services-monthly-data/contents/monthly-data)
h. [AIHW National Hospital Morbidity Database, 2019–20](https://www.aihw.gov.au/about-our-data/our-data-collections/national-hospitals-data-collection)
i. [Services Australia Centrelink Data, 2020](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/statistical-information-and-data?context=1)
j. [An Australian report on Family, domestic and sexual violence service responses during covid-19](https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/domestic-violence/family-domestic-and-sexual-violence-service-respon/summary)

Examples of global data sources include:

a. [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/)
b. [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/)
c. [COVID-19 Data Repository by Johns Hopkins University](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html)

3. **Set of figures/tables to show in the dashboard**:

a. Total Cases and Deaths: Display the cumulative number of confirmed cases and deaths globally and regionally, highlighting the impact of each wave.

b. Daily New Cases and Deaths: Show the trends of new cases and deaths over time, allowing users to observe the spikes during different waves.

c. Testing and Positivity Rates: Include information on testing rates, positive test percentages, and changes in testing strategies over time to provide insights into the scale of each wave and testing capabilities.

d. Hospitalizations and ICU Occupancy: Present data on hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and healthcare system strain during each wave, reflecting the severity of the outbreaks.

e. Vaccination Coverage: Illustrate the progress of vaccination efforts during and between waves to highlight the impact of immunization campaigns on controlling the virus.

f. Geographical Heatmaps: Use color-coded maps to depict the intensity of each wave across different countries or regions, allowing users to identify hotspots and variations in severity.

g. Government Interventions: Present information on government interventions, such as lockdowns, travel restrictions, and mask mandates, to analyze their impact on mitigating or exacerbating the waves.

h. Variants and Genetic Sequencing: Include data on the emergence and spread of different Covid-19 variants during each wave to provide insights into their influence on the severity and characteristics of the outbreaks.

i. From the report indicated in source (j), a graph presenting which locations/regions in 
Australia had a significant volume of reported Domestic violence cases can be included in the dashboard. A geographical heatmap can be used for this.

4. **Analysis strategy**:

Historical Data: Include data from subsequent waves of the Covid-19 pandemic. This data can be obtained from reliable sources such as national and international health organizations, government reports, research papers, and reputable news outlets.

Global Databases: Include data from global databases that collect and aggregate Covid-19 statistics, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and other reputable international health agencies. These sources often provide detailed information about the number of cases, deaths, recoveries, and other relevant metrics from different countries and regions.

Regional and National Data: Access data from various countries and regions to provide a comparative analysis of how different areas experienced the waves. This data can include infection rates, hospitalization rates, fatality rates, testing rates, vaccination rates, and any other relevant metrics.

Research Studies: Incorporate findings from scientific research studies and academic papers that explore the different waves of the pandemic. These studies often analyze factors such as the impact of variants, government interventions, vaccination efforts, and the effectiveness of public health measures in controlling the waves.

Public Health Reports: Consider data and insights from public health reports published by national and local health departments. These reports may provide detailed information on specific waves, including timelines, severity, regional variations, and the effectiveness of containment strategies.
